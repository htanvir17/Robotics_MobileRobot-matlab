# Mobile robot
This repository contains some demo videos of mobile robot project that has a goal of positioning the robot in a correct and estimated way of a trajectory. The ROB (Robotics) course was taken in 2021-Q2, spring season.

In this practice we have applied the concepts of mobile robot and navigation.
- Where is the robot? It implies **location**, it is what interests us
- Where am i going? It implies **FKine**
- How can I get there? It implies **IKine**

Mobile robot control scheme
- first approach (we will apply): classical AI ⇒ **Model based navigation**
- second approach: new AI ⇒ Behavior based navigation

Other concepts:
- Use of landmarks
- Error ellipse
